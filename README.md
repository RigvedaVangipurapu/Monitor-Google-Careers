An automated system that monitors Google Careers for job count changes and sends email alerts when new jobs are posted.

## Features

- üîç Monitors Google Careers job count every hour (Data-related jobs)
- üìß Sends email alerts when job count changes
- üöÄ Runs automatically using GitHub Actions (FREE)
- üìä Tracks changes across all job pages
- üîí Secure email configuration using GitHub Secrets

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all files from this project to the repository
3. Make sure the repository is public (for free GitHub Actions)

### 2. Configure Email Settings

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add the following secrets:

| Secret Name | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `SMTP_SERVER` | Your email provider's SMTP server | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port (usually 587) | `587` |
| `SENDER_EMAIL` | Your email address | `your.email@gmail.com` |
| `SENDER_PASSWORD` | Your email password or app password | `your_password` |
| `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Where to send alerts | `alerts@yourdomain.com` |

### 3. Email Provider Setup

#### For Gmail:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an "App Password" for this application
3. Use the app password as `SENDER_PASSWORD`

#### For Outlook/Hotmail:
- Use `smtp-mail.outlook.com` as SMTP_SERVER
- Use your regular password

#### For Other Providers:
- Check your email provider's SMTP settings

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
3. The workflow will start running automatically every hour

## How It Works

1. **Every hour**, GitHub Actions runs the monitoring script
2. **Extracts** the current job count from Google Careers
3. **Compares** with the previously stored count
4. **Sends email** if the count has changed
5. **Updates** the stored count for the next run

## Monitoring

- Check the **Actions** tab in your repository to see run history
- View logs to see what the script detected
- Email alerts will be sent to your configured recipient

## Customization

### Change Monitoring Frequency
Edit `.github/workflows/career-monitor.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 */2 * * *'  # Every 2 hours
  - cron: '0 9,17 * * *'  # 9 AM and 5 PM daily
```

### Change Target URL
Edit `career_monitor.py`:
```python
TARGET_URL = "your_custom_career_page_url"
```

### Change Job Selector
If the job count element changes, update:
```python
JOB_COUNT_SELECTOR = "your_new_selector"
```

## Files

- `career_monitor.py` - Main monitoring script
- `.github/workflows/career-monitor.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
